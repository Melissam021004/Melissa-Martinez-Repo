Hi! My name is Melissa Martinez, and I am a 2026 Computer Science and Molecular and Cellular Biology Bachelor's Graduate and a 2027 Data Science Master's Graduate from Johns Hopkins University. This repository contains my work from my undergraduate classes, as well as some larger-scale and more advanced projects that I have worked on recently. The projects all touch on varying languages and topics, with the majority of the projects being in C++, Java, and Python. 


I am eager to learn and enjoy being thrown into projects with limited guidance, as it gives me the freedom to think about the problem in different ways and test out various approaches. For example, I did as such while leading the Orioles project, where our instructions were simply to find the outfield dimensions. Therefore, I was allowed to explore many different algorithms and actually found out about many of them for the first time, and the final project is a combination of my approaches along the way.
